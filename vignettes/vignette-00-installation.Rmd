## Quick installation

*slendr* is currently on its way to CRAN so it's not yet possible to install it with simple `install.packages("slendr")`. In the meantime, the easiest way to install its development version directly from GitHub executing `devtools::install_github("bodkan/slendr")`.

## 

The complete functionality of *slendr* (i.e., programming of spatial SLiM simulations, coalescent simulations with *msprime*, and processing and analysis of tree-sequence files with the R-*tskit* interface) relies on three main software dependencies:

1.  geospatial data analysis R package [*sf*](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/),
2.  forward population genetic simulator [SLiM](https://messerlab.org/slim/),
3.  Python modules [*tskit*, *msprime*, and *pyslim*](https://tskit.dev/)*.*

All three are extremely popular and widely used pieces of software which are easily available on all major operating systems. In this vignette, I will briefly explain how to get all of *slendr*'s software dependencies installed, noting that under normal circumstances, with the exception of SLiM, no manual installation of individual dependencies is required.

Please note that at the moment only macOS and Linux are fully supported and tested. However, because all of *slendr*'s dependencies are available also on Windows, I hope to make the R package fully portable as soon as I get access to a Windows machine to do testing on. In the meantime, if you're a Windows user, I suggest you consider using the official [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) which should get you a proper Linux environment on your machine.
